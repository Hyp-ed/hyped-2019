IMU data for 5 orientations, sensor still to measure gravity:
file imu1_runij_data.csv contains info for jth run of orientation i

orientation     position description                                        expected acceleration
orientation 1: flat on surface (all gravity on z-axis)                      (0, 0, 9.81)
orientation 2: 45 deg angle flat (gravity on y- and z-axis)                 (0, 6.93, 6.93)
orientation 3: flat surface pointing upwards (all gravity on y-axis)        (0, 9.81, 0)
orientation 4: on side (all gravity on x-axis)                              (9.81, 0, 0)
orientation 5: on side flipped (- all gravity on x-axis)                    (-9.81, 0, 0)

6.93 ~ 9.81/sqrt(2)
