## Running the telemetry module
If you're running this on your laptop, make sure you've followed the [guide on building the protobufs library](#building-protobufs). Programs that use the telemetry module will not work unless protobufs is installed. If running on a beaglebone however, protobufs should already be installed.

*In the past telemetry files had to manually be added to `Source.files`, this is now automated!*

Whenever you want to compile a program that uses the telemetry module, make sure to use the `PROTOBUF=1` flag. For example:
```
$ make MAIN=demo_telem.cpp PROTOBUF=1
```
The linker will run into errors if this is not specified.

If you're running this locally on your laptop, make sure `config.txt` has the `IP` specified as `localhost` and `Port` as `9090`. If using the Rockets, `Port` will be the same but `IP` will now be the static ip address of the access point computer (if you've followed the guide below word for word it should be `192.168.1.40`).

Now you can run `./hyped` and it should work!

## Building Protobufs
***Refer to [this readme file](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md) from the protobufs library***.

**Note for Windows users:**
Unfortunately I haven't tried building the library on Windows, and the process seems to be quite different (unless you are using cygwin or similar) so I suggest following the instructions [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md#c-installation---windows). Just make sure you download **protoc-3.6.1-win32.zip** from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.6.1) (pretty sure using a later release is fine since they're backwards-compatible, but use 3.6.1 just to avoid any potential conflicts).

On Unix machines, make sure the following are installed:
- autoconf
- automake
- libtool
- make
- g++
- unzip

Chances are they're already installed. If not, on Ubuntu/Debian run:
```
$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool curl make g++ unzip
```

On Mac's they will also likely be installed (xcode command line tools are also required, but this will almost certainly be already installed as it's a requirement for `g++` anyways).

Now, download the source files for protobufs from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.6.1). Make sure you choose **protobuf-java-3.6.1.zip** (the java parts of the library are only necessary if you want to work on the telemetry base-station and you could install the pure c++ version if you wanted, but I'd recommend downloading it anyways). Place these files where you want.

**Warning: the following will likely take around an hour (sad reaccs), so only proceed when you have the time for it**

Navigate to the root of the source protobufs directory. Now build and install the library by running the following:
```
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```
On Mac's [you can ignore](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/2570#issuecomment-271358087) `sudo ldconfig`.

Check if protobufs was installed:
```
$ protoc --version
libprotoc 3.6.1
```

Now if you want to run code that uses the telemetry module refer to [this guide](#running-the-telemetry-module).

## Connecting the Rockets
***Read instructions below sequentially***
<br>
***Use [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zKNIveuCxM&feature=youtu.be) as reference***
<br>
*Just to clarify Access Point Computer refers to the computer with the designated Access Point Rocket plugged in; Station Computer refers to the computer with the designated Station Rocket plugged in*
<br>

### Physical setup
- Plug in both rocket adapters into sockets
- Plug in ethernet cable from rocket into POE socket of adapter (for both rockets)
- Plug in ethernet cable from laptop into LAN socket of adapter (for both laptops)
- Screw in antenna (for both rockets)
- **Restart** both rockets (use pen to hold restart button for ten seconds) - *idk why but without a restart connections seems to stop working later*

### On Access Point Computer
- Configure static IP address for ethernet interface
  - This will depend on your operating system, but typically under network settings somewhere (watch video for reference)
  - Set IP address to `192.168.1.40`
  - Set Subnet Mask to `255.255.255.0`
- Try `ping 192.168.1.20`
  - If request times out or other error, restart rocket and try again
- If ping above works, go to `192.168.1.20` in browser, where AirOS login screen should show up
- Login
  - *Username*: `ubnt`
  - *Password*: should be `ubnt` as well, but if not try `password1234`
- On AirOS page, click on `Wireless` tab
  - Set `Wireless Mode` to `Access Point`
  - Check `WDS (Transparent Bridge Mode)` box
  - Set `SSID` to `ubnt-bridge`
  - Set `Frequency` to `917` - *not sure why, seems to work better when this is set, feel free to mess around with this*
  - Set `Security` to `WPA2-AES`
  - Set `WPA Authentication` to `PSK`
  - Set `WPA Preshared Key` to `password1234` - *can be what you want, but we use password1234 just to keep things simple*
  - Click `Change` button in bottom right, and apply changes
- On AirOS page, click on `Network` tab
  - Set `IP Address` to `192.168.1.159`
  - Set `Subnet Mask` to `255.255.255.0`
  - Click `Change` button in bottom right, and apply changes
 
### On Station Computer
- Configure static IP address for ethernet interface
  - This will depend on your operating system, but typically under network settings somewhere (watch video for reference)
  - Set IP address to `192.168.1.50`
  - Set Subnet Mask to `255.255.255.0`
- Try `ping 192.168.1.20`
  - If request times out or other error, restart rocket and try again
- If ping above works, go to `192.168.1.20` in browser, where AirOS login screen should show up
- Login
  - *Username*: `ubnt`
  - *Password*: should be `ubnt` as well, but if not try `password1234`
- On AirOS page, click on `Wireless` tab
  - Set `Wireless Mode` to `Station`
  - Check `WDS (Transparent Bridge Mode)` box
  - Click `Select...` button next to `SSID` text box to start site survey
    - Select `ubnt-bridge` (this is our access point Rocket M900)
    - Click `Lock to AP`
  - Set `Security` to `WPA2-AES`
  - Set `WPA Authentication` to `PSK`
  - Set `WPA Preshared Key` to the **same password** we set for our access point Rocket (should be `password1234`)!!
  - Click `Change` button in bottom right, and apply changes
- On AirOS page, click on `Network` tab
  - Set `IP Address` to `192.168.1.160`
  - Set `Subnet Mask` to `255.255.255.0`
  - Click `Change` button in bottom right, and apply changes
- Open up port 9090 by running `sudo ufw allow 9090` - *command is for Ubuntu, use respective command for your OS, also not sure if this is really necessary, just do it in case :)*
